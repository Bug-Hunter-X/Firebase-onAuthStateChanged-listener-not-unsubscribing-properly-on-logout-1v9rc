# Firebase onAuthStateChanged Listener Unsubscription Issue

This repository demonstrates a common issue with Firebase Authentication's `onAuthStateChanged` listener: failure to properly unsubscribe when a user logs out.  The listener continues to execute, leading to potential errors and unexpected behavior.

## Problem

The provided `onAuthStateChanged` listener does not unsubscribe after logout, leading to persistent execution, even after the user logs out.  This can cause unnecessary code execution and potential errors.

## Solution

The solution involves explicitly calling the `unsubscribe()` function when the component or function using the listener is unmounted or no longer needed.  This ensures that the listener is properly removed, preventing further execution after logout.
